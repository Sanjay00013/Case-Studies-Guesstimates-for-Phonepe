Scenario Based Questions
Scenario 1:
A fintech company offers a mobile payment app where users can link their bank accounts and make payments. The company wants to analyse the retention of users who signed up for the app in the past six months to understand how often they continue using it after the initial download.
Question 1:
How would you perform a cohort analysis to calculate the monthly retention rate for users who signed up in different months?
Hint: Group users by the month they signed up, and track their activity (i.e., whether they made any transactions) in subsequent months.
Question 2:
If you find that retention drops significantly after the first month, what are some possible reasons for this behaviour, and how can the company address this drop-off?
Hint: Consider user engagement strategies such as onboarding improvements, notifications for unused accounts, or offering discounts for making a second transaction.
Scenario 2:
The fintech company is testing two different loan approval notification designs. Version A is a simple approval message, while Version B includes additional loan details (e.g., repayment options, interest rate, and payment reminders). They want to see which design leads to more loan acceptance.
Question 1:
How would you structure an A/B test to measure the impact of these notification designs on loan acceptance rates?
Hint: Track loan acceptance rates (percentage of users who accept the loan offer), average loan amount, and repayment behaviours after loan acceptance.
Question 2:
Suppose Version B (detailed notification) results in a 10% increase in loan acceptance rates but requires additional resources to implement. How would you evaluate whether the increase in acceptance rates justifies the added complexity?
Hint: Consider the potential revenue increase from higher loan acceptance rates and whether the costs of implementing Version B are outweighed by the financial benefits. You might also suggest simplifying some of the details to reduce complexity.
